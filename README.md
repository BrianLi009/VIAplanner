# VIAplanner

VIAplanner is a tool designed by students at the University of Toronto to help the community. We desire to enhance the course selection process.

## Introduction

The fundamental problem we are trying to solve :
1. The current process is to choose your courses and manually create a schedule without any conflicts. This can take days to perfect.

2. With the help of this tool, we are making this process faster and easier than before.

3. Furthermore, this will improve UofT's reputation since this tool will modernize a crucial part of a student's life.
